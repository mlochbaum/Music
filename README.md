Some electronic music implemented in BQN with [BQNoise](https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQNoise).

Runs with [dzaima/BQN](https://github.com/dzaima/BQN). See config.bqn to configure paths.

Currently just ports of some material previously written in J. Hopefully I'll eventually add some scripts that are better for learning BQN and/or synthesis.

To avoid confusion, the BSD-0 license for this repository applies to musical content as well as code. If while working with these scripts you somehow produce something you'd feel okay about publishing, you have no need to fear any copyright claims from me.
