Some electronic music implemented in BQN with [BQNoise](https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQNoise).

Runs with [https://github.com/dzaima/BQN](dzaima/BQN). See config.bqn to configure paths.

Currently just ports of some material previously written in J. Hopefully I'll eventually add aome scripts that are better for learning BQN and/or synthesis.
